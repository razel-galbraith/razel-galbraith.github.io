    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>  <p>
        the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
        "emotional intelligence is the key to both personal and professional success"
        
        Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence is generally said to include a few skills: namely emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one’s own emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one’s own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same.
        
        <ul>
          <li>Self-awareness - Identifying emotions  The ability to understand oneself, strengths and weaknesses, and how your emotions affect those around you.</li>
          <li>Self-regulation - Controlling one's own emotionsDetermines your ability to stay in control of your emotions. Those adept at self-regulation take time to process emotions before acting, or reacting, allowing for a calmer take.</li>
          <li>Motivation - Most people are familiar with. It involves working consistently and optimistically towards your goals and having high standards for your own work. Desire to truly succeed.</li>
          <li>Empathy -    Perceiving how others feel Evaluating how others feel The ability to put yourself in another person’s situation and understand their feelings or emotions. This can happen without verbal communication. Empathetic people often read body language and facial expressions to understand emotions in others without words.</li>
          <li>Social skills -          Using emotions to facilitate social communication
            Relating to others Involve anything related to communicating and relating to others. Those with fine tuned social skills are good at building rapport with those around them and this facilitates open communication.</li></ul>
        
                 
             
            <h3>The Difference Between EQ and IQ</h3>
        
        <p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
        Emotional intelligence is distinct from IQ. “Your EQ is the level of your ability to understand other people, what motivates them and how to work cooperatively with them,” Harvard education professor Howard Gardner explains. In some ways, EQ is far more important and valuable than IQ.
        
        The important difference between IQ and EQ is that EQ can be developed. </p>
        
      <h3>The Important and Relevance of EQ</h3>
        
        <p>By gaining more experience and education, professionals can improve their EQ and become better leaders. Organizations can identify who needs improvement in EQ and develop strategies to increase it. This can help companies foster new leaders more efficiently than looking for pure intellect.
        
        EQ helps organizations understand the intangibles that make leaders successful. EQ is the strongest predictor of performance.
        
        Are the emotionally intelligent more motivated?
        These people are able to mobilize and utilize their emotions, and they are motivated to manage tasks and problem-solve obstacles. They are connected to who they are and what they value in life, which are foundational for prioritizing and reaching any objective or goal. Knowing what matters is crucial for productivity.</p>
