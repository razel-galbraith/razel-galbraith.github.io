    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>  <p>
        Emotional Intelligence can be thought of as the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
        The following are core skills of Emotional Intelligence:<p>


        <table>
          <tr>
            <td style="width:15%"><strong>Self-awareness:</strong></td>
            <td>Identifying your own emotions. To understand your sense of self, your strengths and weaknesses, and how your emotions affect others.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Self-regulation:</strong></td>
            <td>Being able to control your own emotions. This means being able to process emotions before acting, or reacting, allowing for a calmer and more thoughtful perspective.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Motivation:</strong></td>
            <td>Working consistently and optimistically towards a goal and having high standards for your own work. A desire to succeed.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Empathy:</strong></td>
            <td>Perceiving how others feel Evaluating how others feel The ability to put yourself in another person’s situation and understand their feelings or emotions.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Social skills:</strong></td>
            <td>Facilitating social communication. Relating to others. Being able to build a rapport with others.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
                 
      <h3>The Difference Between EQ and IQ</h3>
        
        <p>Emotional Quotient (EQ) is distinct from Intelligence Quotient (IQ).<br>          
          IQ measures the ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. 
          EQ measures the ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
          The important difference between IQ and EQ is that EQ can be developed. </p>
        
      <h3>The Important and Relevance of EQ</h3>
      
        <p>By gaining more experience and education, professionals can improve their EQ and become better leaders. 
          Organizations can identify who needs improvement in EQ and develop strategies to increase it. 
          This can help companies foster new leaders more efficiently than looking for pure intellect.
  
        EQ helps organizations understand the intangibles that make leaders successful. EQ is the strongest predictor of performance.
        
        Some people consider that "emotional intelligence is the key to both personal and professional success".

        Are the emotionally intelligent more motivated?
        These people are able to mobilize and utilize their emotions, and they are motivated to manage tasks and problem-solve obstacles. 
        They are connected to who they are and what they value in life, which are foundational for prioritizing and reaching any objective or goal. 
        Knowing what matters is crucial for productivity.</p>
