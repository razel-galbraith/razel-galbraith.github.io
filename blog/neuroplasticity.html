    <h3>The Benefits of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to physically and chemically change and adapt, as a result of learning and experience.
      <p>There are two main types of neuroplasticity.</p>
      <p>      
      <strong>Functional plasticity</strong> is the brain's ability to alter and adapt the functional properties of neurons, either through previous activity or as a response to damage. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Structural plasticity</strong> is the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure, its neuronal connection, as a result of learning. New neurons are constantly produced and integrated into the central nervous system throughout the life span.
      </p>
      <p>
      
      The benefits of brain neuroplasticity include:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
          <li>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</li>
          <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
          <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li>
          <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      
    
      
     <h3>How I Might Engage With the Principles of Neuroplasticity for My Benefit:</h3>
      
      <p>
      As I learn complex new languages, learn to work and think differently, neuroplasticity can help me with my capacity to grow and develop. By practising, keeping engaged, being curious and investigating, my brain is being reshaped to accommodate this new information.
      </p>
      <p>
      Practice and repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing the material helps with both understanding and self-confidence. Instead of the rote learning I am used to, I know if I put information into context and see a relationship between information that it becomes embedded in my knowledge. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I am also using this to improve my frame of mind and practice positive thinking.</p>
    
      
      <p>
      I must also be more conscious of my workspace and lifestyle in order to increase my neuroplasticity. I enrich my environment by setting up a quiet and private office space that I keep tidy and beautiful with flowers and lighting, as opposed to my noisy dining room. I am starting to go for daily walks and looking to increase my exercise, and go to sleep earlier, even though I'm usually a night owl. I need to make sure I'm taking care of myself physically too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank">Verywell Mind</a> has been a great resource in helping to learning about neuroplasticity.</p>

     <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
      According to <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others tend to achieve more than those who believe their talents are innate gifts. 
        
      Instead of only wanting to appear smart, the focus becomes more about learning, empowerment, collaboration and innovation.
      This becomes increasingly more relevant in the workplace, as the employees with a growth mindset are more likely to be team players and willing to learn, as well as allowing them to be happier and fulfilled, thus improving the workplace culture for all.</p>
      
      
      It is no surprise to me that the growth mindset is important and applicable to my career. Perhaps what was more surprising, was my realisation of how much of a fixed mindset I have had most of my life, not only with academic learning and skills but also physical and social abilities.
      
      
     <h3>How I Will Integrate Growth Mindset Into My Learning Journey:</h3>
      
     <p>
      I will strive to: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporate more positive self-talk and encouragement</li>
        <li>Keep practicing, and not giving up when I hit a roadblock or challenge</li>
        <li>Setting attainable goals that I reward or celebrate in some way/li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have found the following YouTube videos on Mindset to be interesting:<br>

      <h3>Impact On My Learning Plan & Strategies</h3> 
      <p>
        Embracing a growth mindset will be of utmost importance as I journey into Bootcamp. I need to engage with the material and practice every day, and assure myself that my comprehension and skills are improving the more I do this. I will remind myself that it is not about looking like the best or smartest person that doesn't need any help, but about doing what I need to do to make sure I am truly understanding the material, even if that means ignoring my fear or rejection or failure.
