    <h3>The Benefits of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience. It is also known as brain plasticity, However, when people say that the brain possesses plasticity, they are not suggesting that the brain is similar to plastic.
      
      Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability, which is defined as being "easily influenced, trained, or controlled."1 Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Thus, neuroplasticity is when nerve cells change or adjust.
      
      
      Today, it's understood that the brain possesses the remarkable capacity to reorganize pathways, create new connections, and, in some cases, even create new neurons—neuroplasticity.
      
      There are two main types of neuroplasticity:
      
      Functional plasticity is the brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas.
      Functional plasticity refers to brain's ability to alter and adapt the functional properties of neurons. The changes can occur in response to previous activity (activity-dependent plasticity) to acquire memory or in response to malfunction or damage of neurons (maladaptive plasticity) to compensate a pathological event.
      
      Structural plasticity is the brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning. Structural plasticity is often understood as the brain's ability to change its neuronal connections. New neurons are constantly produced and integrated into the central nervous system throughout the life span based on this type of neuroplasticity. 
      
      Because as we gain new experiences, some connections are strengthened while others are eliminated. This process is known as synaptic pruning.
      
      There are many benefits of brain neuroplasticity. Allowing your brain to adapt and change helps promote:4
      
      The ability to learn new things
      The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities
      Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries
      Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined
      Improvements that can boost brain fitness 
      
      Still, there are limits to how much the brain can adapt.

     <h3>How I Might Engage With the Principles of Neuroplasticity for My Benefit:</h3>
      
      <p>Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing the material in various ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.
      
      Put information in context. Relationship between information.
      
      Positive thinking.
    </p>
      
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      
      <p>
      Enrich your environment
      Exercise
      Rest
      
      Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has led experiments in collaboration with the Dalai Lama on effects of meditation on the brain. His results suggest that meditation may lead to change in the physical structure of brain regions associated with attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and compassion as well as the ability of the body to heal itself.[75][76][77][78]

     <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      
      ## Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      
      HBR: 
      Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others tend to achieve more than those who believe their talents are innate gifts. 
      
      This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning. When entire companies embrace a growth mindset, their employees report feeling far more empowered and committed; they also receive far greater organizational support for collaboration and innovation. In contrast, people at primarily fixed-mindset companies report more of only one thing: cheating and deception among employees, presumably to gain an advantage in the talent race.
      
      False growth mindsets. Both fixed and growth.
      
      Learning and progress. Outcomes.
      Implement real and attainable policies.
      Lessons learned.
      
      Not easy.
      Fixed triggers, challenges, comparisons.
      
      We all have beliefs about our own abilities and potential. These beliefs are part of our mindset, which is so powerful they can fuel our behavior and predict our success. Mindset shapes our everyday lives, helping us interpret our experiences and future possibilities. 
      
      A willingness to confront challenges, a passion for learning, and viewing failure as a springboard for growth are all characteristics associated with a growth mindset. Not surprisingly, this type of mindset is strongly linked to greater happiness and achievement in life.
      
      In contrast, those with a fixed mindset believe their intelligence and abilities cannot be altered in a meaningful way. As a result, mistakes are often seen as failures rather than opportunities to grow and learn. When stuck in a fixed mindset, we may fear new experiences, avoid risks, and feel the need to repeatedly prove ourselves over and over again.
      
      
      
      # In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      No surprises that the growth mindset is important, applicable. Perhaps it was more of my own realisation of how much of a fixed mindset I have had most of my life, not only with academic learning and skills but also physical and social abilities.
      
      
     <h3>How I Will Integrate Growth Mindset Into My Learning Journey</h3>
      
     <p>
      Positive self-talk and encouragement
      Practice makes perfect, not giving up
      Attainable goals that I reward or celebrate in some way

      # Blend with your learning plan and strategies
      

      ## Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
