### What is my site's primary purpose?

My site's primary purpose is to demonstrate my learnings and understanding of HTML & CSS, displayed as who I am and my learning journey.

### Who is my audience? (is it kids, adults, academics)?

My audience are my teachers and peers - so fellow academcics.

### How will I build my site to support their user experience?

I will build my site in a way that is clear, concise and easy to navigate but also make it appealing to the eye.

### Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!

Yes drawn in a journal.

### What other directories do I need (e.g. images)? Where do I put that directory?

I can make an images directory.

### Do I also want the style to be applied to all of my blog entries?

I see it having one cohesive style throughout the website so there is continuity between the blog entries.

Learning Competencies:

[x] Set up a basic HTML page with the appropriate tags (HTML, head, title, etc.)

### Learning Plan

### What is your long term goal or career pathway?
After being a marketing professional for the last decade or so, and a laboratory scientist prior to that, I'm finally pushing myself to do what my heart wanted to when I was younger and has been on my mind ever since - and that is coding!
### A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
My strengths are my ability to hyperfocus when I'm truly excited and interesting in learning something. This means that if something is confusing or tricky, or if I'm not understanding 100%, I'll got out of my way to find it out. Google is usually my first friend, but I have no problem reaching out to someone who knows more than me to help me out! I'm a very visual learner, so if I can see examples or do something practically myself, this really helps to solidify new information.

On the flipside, I am very easily distracted and need to actively prevent distractions and procrastinating. 
Even simple tasks take a bit of a mental exercise to get me to begin them! In addition, I can be quite hard on myself when I don't pick something up right away or it's not making sense. That annoying self-doubt voice likes to pop up, which I also need to actively stop.

### What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
In my corporate experience, working with people of differing skills, backgrounds and personalities could be more challenging than the task or project at hand. I can get social anxiety in group situations or speaking in front of people. I feel collaboration and being able to present my technical projects confidently is definitely something I would like to see developed during my study at Dev Academy.

### A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

  ## An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives

  ## What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you


### A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

# My Commitment
I understand that there is an intensity to this course which requires my full focus and time if I want to succeed. I am commited to completing this course not only to attain a career I truly love but also for my family. The requirements of our week and learning competencies are clear; this means I can effectively timeblock using my calendar. Allocating time specifically to work on each part, as well as when I need to do other family or personal things, means that time doesn't get away from me and by then end of the week I shouldn't feel like I have run out of time.  

To work productively and safely with others, I will incorporate kindness, understanding and knowledge-sharing with everyone I interact with. Being in the online-only cohort, words can be misconstrued in chats, and limited face-time with my peers and facilitators means I need to take extra effort to be thoughtful in what I say and do. I also want others to know that I am safe to talk to - I will do my utmost best to be understanding and non-judgemental. 

When things get overwhelming, or I'm finding myself in too much a state of anxiety, this is my cue to take a step back and breathe. Self-care is as important as the learning itself.  

If it is learning related, I can reach out to my peers or my facilitators to help work through it. I will give it a good attempt to figure it out for myself but there is a point, perhaps after a few hours if I'm not getting anywhere, that I need to reach out to someone else. This is not only to help with time, but also so I don't get too much inside my head with negativity.

If it is personal, I have excellent support in my home life if I am needing additional help managing my time, need a moment to do something mindful or just need to vent to someone. 

### A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
I expect the Facilitation team to be our guides and mentors, which so far they have already proven to do.
Helping us through problems and learning by walking through them, allowing us to figure it out for ourselves. I am also someone that needs detailed feedback - if I am on the right track or if I need to work on something more. It's helpful if they are easy to approach, that we don't feel ridiculous or dumb if we ask something seemingly simple.

### Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

I have a two and four year-old, and before they leave for preschool in the morning and when they get home until bedtime, they need my undivided attention. I am sharing the drop-offs and pick-ups with my husband; their grandfather as a back-up. I've clearly discussed with them my studying time commitments of 8.45am-5.15pm. If in an unexpected circumstance I am late, or one of them falls sick, I'll manage this directly with the facilitators to get around it and make sure I don't get behind. Luckily, I am a night owl so I can work well in the evenings and have also factored in both family and study time on the weekends.

"Your core values act like your internal compass which navigates the course of your life. If you compromise your core values, you go nowhere." Roy T Bennett The Light in the Heart

"Integrity is choosing your thoughts and actions based on values rather than personal gain"

"Values are an internal reference for what is good or bad, desirable or undesirable in ourselves and others. They are moral principles, based on beliefs, so significant to the individual that they drive our behaviour: interactions with others and the world."


Your review of learning.




Blog post should include the following:

**Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.**



**Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.**

Growing up as a young Filipino in Hamilton, New Zealand, I have felt different from others.


**Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.**

Love
Appreciation of beauty and excellence
Gratitude
Curiosity
Humility

**Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?**

From a traditional science and marketing background. Tertiary education.
Self-assessment

**Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.**



Going through this exercise, it has made me realise how tricky it actually is to articulate what one's values are, and who we are. Is it our experiences, environment? How people who truly know us perceive us? Or how we approach and view the world. It is perhaps a harmony of all these things. 

Being able to look back at my upbringing, plus my educational and professional experiences, I think I can tackle this learning journey with greater self-awareness of how I learn best and be motivated to do my best.

I've always taken a great interest in coding, and I chose Dev Academy because I think the high intensity, core elements and market relevance will best prepare me for a career change.
