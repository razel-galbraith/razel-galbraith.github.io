### What is my site's primary purpose?

My site's primary purpose is to demonstrate my learnings and understanding of HTML & CSS, displayed as who I am and my learning journey.

### Who is my audience? (is it kids, adults, academics)?

My audience are my teachers and peers - so fellow academcics.

### How will I build my site to support their user experience?

I will build my site in a way that is clear, concise and easy to navigate but also make it appealing to the eye.

### Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!

Yes drawn in a journal.

### What other directories do I need (e.g. images)? Where do I put that directory?

I can make an images directory.

### Do I also want the style to be applied to all of my blog entries?

I see it having one cohesive style throughout the website so there is continuity between the blog entries.
