<h3>Problem Solving and Pseudocode</h3>

Why problem-solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
A variety of problem-solving techniques you can use today (starting with pseudocode).

*Pseudocode*
Comments. Informal.
Code one step at a time.
General steps.
defines the structure of your code and it will help you to write every line of code that you need in order to solve the problem
Code readability


pseudocode throughout your kata to help you understand what each line of code is doing (plus, this allows us to see your line of thinking when we mark your work)
Login, not syntax


The rubber ducky method
Debugging technique. When a programmer gets held back by bugs, the code is explained line by line to a rubber duck.
Duck can't fix or respond. Keep expanding and explaining until it's clear to yourself. Identify mistakes or pick up discrepancies.


Reading error messages
JavaScript error reference
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

Call stack/stack log

Console.logging
Debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.

See what parts of code are working, what information the computer has

Googling
Search the problem
Research and refine
See what others have done, how they came up with that solution
Explanations and alternatives
Different perspective or language might help it to be clearerr

Trying something
Test different formats, functions, syntax, order of code until the desired output is achieved.
break down problems into small manageable pieces!
Done is better than perfect
Get it as close as possible. Don't focus on the smallest details. Hackathon.


Asking your peers for help
Don't be afraid/shy/embarassed

when you get stuck, ask for help to get unblocked. The Foundations Discord channel is the best place to ask as all Foundations students are working on this same challenge, and we can guarantee you're not alone whenever you feel blocked!

Fresh eyes. Able to explain it one on one. Show your workings and what you were trying to achieve and they might see something you couldn't.

Asking coaches for help
Don't be afraid
More experience



Improving your process with reflection
Hindsight
Pinpoint where it went wrong
Research backwards
Relax. Break. Sleep. 15 minutes away from problem for sub conscious. 
Refactor code, make more elegant, tidy, simple.

TDD
red green pass fail 

Keep practising and learning!
