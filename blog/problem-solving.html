<h3>1. A Time I Was Blocked On A Simple Problem:</h3>

<p class="blog">
When I first started learning JavaScript in all of Sprint 3, I came across a problem that I knew was simple and that others were flying through. It was the <em>Loops</em> exercise in the JavaScript Introduction. I was just getting my head around loops and I couldn't for the life of me get it to count down backwards. I first did what I usually do which was Google and Try, so I repeatedly entered different commands but could not quite get it. Part of it was perhaps not knowing the name of the methods/commands or the best one to use. I was definitely in my uncomfortable learning space, where everything was new and I had the negative self-talk in my ear about not being able to get it; will I ever get it. Because I knew it was simple, I held back from asking my peers for help on Discord in the fear that it would validate that negative self-talk. After continued searching I finally got the solution, but I realised how much time and energy I had wasted by agonising over it instead of just reaching out. I know that from now, if my typical methods are not working or efficient enough, I need to be brave enough to try something else like asking someone.

<h3>2. A Time When I Elegantly Solved A Problem:</h3>

<p>
As I incrementally learn and develop my JavaScript skill set, I have been somewhat more comfortable in Sprint 4. This time, instead of looking at the end and seeing a huge, scary, obstacle, breaking it down by pseudocoding and really trying to understand it one step, variable and function at a time has helped immensely. In a purely novice sense, I felt that I elegantly solved the <em>Manipulating JS Objects</em> exercise on repl.it. I was confident in how to break down the problem, research solutions and test them. Thus, a combination of Googling, trying code and reading error messages allowed me to proceed through this one without feeling overwhelmed or inadequate, and dare I say it, proud of myself.

      <td style="width:15%"><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></td>
      <td style="width:5%"><strong>4/5</strong></td>
      <td>This method is proving to be very helpful in allowing me to break down a problem into smaller, easier to see steps. There is room for improvement as I still need figure out the best steps and sometimes go back and amend them, but I am confident using it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Trying something:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>4/5</strong></td>
      <td>This is my go-to method. Just trial and error until it works! Perhaps not the most efficient way though, as unless I'm on the right path it can take a very long time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>3/5</strong></td>
      <td>I haven't put this one to use yet, but I think could implement it when the time is right. Perhaps will be most useful when creating or developing something where I'm not clear on the end goal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Reading error messages:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>3/5</strong></td>
      <td>I like this method because it's instant, and I can see what part of the code isn't working and also a complex reason why. I still require some experience to decipher them, however.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Console.logging:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>4/5</strong></td>
      <td>I have been trying to console.log frequently, and check if I am on the right track for particular lengthy or complicated problems. It helps to confirm that my function is behaving as expected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Googling:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>5/5</strong></td>
      <td>Love this method; helps me to see example solutions and alternative ways to achieve the same result. This is usually combined with my trial and error technique. At the very least, it can help with definitions and explanations to set me on my way.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Asking peers for help:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>3/5</strong></td>
      <td>I have reached out now and then on Discord and my peers have been more than happy to assist me. I try to save this for when the above methods are not working. I'll also search Discord to check if the problem has been mentioned prior.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>2/5</strong></td>
      <td>I know the coaches are there to help and guide, but I save this one until all my other methods are exhausted. I would like to improve on this over the course of Bootcamp, as I know I need to utilise my time as efficiently as possible.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Improving the process with reflection:</strong></td>
      <td><strong>3/5</strong></td>
      <td>I like to reflect on past problems that I had difficulty with, and try to understand how the solution is working. It's also great to remember a method previously used and knowing it could work in a different instance.</td>

<h3>Problem Solving and Pseudocode</h3>

Why problem-solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
A variety of problem-solving techniques you can use today (starting with pseudocode).

*Pseudocode*
Comments. Informal.
Code one step at a time.
General steps.
defines the structure of your code and it will help you to write every line of code that you need in order to solve the problem
Code readability


pseudocode throughout your kata to help you understand what each line of code is doing (plus, this allows us to see your line of thinking when we mark your work)
Login, not syntax


The rubber ducky method
Debugging technique. When a programmer gets held back by bugs, the code is explained line by line to a rubber duck.
Duck can't fix or respond. Keep expanding and explaining until it's clear to yourself. Identify mistakes or pick up discrepancies.


Reading error messages
JavaScript error reference
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

Call stack/stack log

Console.logging
Debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

The console.log() method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.

See what parts of code are working, what information the computer has

Googling
Search the problem
Research and refine
See what others have done, how they came up with that solution
Explanations and alternatives
Different perspective or language might help it to be clearerr

Trying something
Test different formats, functions, syntax, order of code until the desired output is achieved.
break down problems into small manageable pieces!
Done is better than perfect
Get it as close as possible. Don't focus on the smallest details. Hackathon.


Asking your peers for help
Don't be afraid/shy/embarassed

when you get stuck, ask for help to get unblocked. The Foundations Discord channel is the best place to ask as all Foundations students are working on this same challenge, and we can guarantee you're not alone whenever you feel blocked!

Fresh eyes. Able to explain it one on one. Show your workings and what you were trying to achieve and they might see something you couldn't.

Asking coaches for help
Don't be afraid
More experience



Improving your process with reflection
Hindsight
Pinpoint where it went wrong
Research backwards
Relax. Break. Sleep. 15 minutes away from problem for sub conscious. 
Refactor code, make more elegant, tidy, simple.

TDD
red green pass fail 

Keep practising and learning!
